# 🐱 fCC Cat Painting

This is a pure HTML and CSS project built as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design course. The goal was to build a stylized cat head using only `div` elements and CSS styles — no images, no JavaScript!

## 🧠 What I Learned

### ✅ HTML
- Structuring a webpage with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- Organizing content using semantic tags like `<main>`.
- Using nested `<div>` elements to build complex shapes.

### 🎨 CSS
- **Positioning**: Used `position: absolute` to place facial features.
- **Gradients**: Used `linear-gradient()` to create depth in the cat's head.
- **Borders for Shapes**: Created triangles and other shapes with `border-*` properties.
- **Transformations**: Rotated elements using `transform: rotate()` for ears, eyes, and whiskers.
- **Styling Hierarchies**: Structured CSS in a modular and readable format using descriptive class names.
- **Rounded Corners**: Applied `border-radius` for soft edges and realism.
